## About ##

We are a computational neuroscience research group and part of the [Bristol Neural Computation Hub](https://bristolcnu.github.io) at the [University of Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk) in the fine city of Bristol, in south-west UK. In October 2021 we will move to the Magee campus of Ulster University, in Derry, Northern Ireland.

## Research ##
We work on three main areas: *Learning & Memory*, *Autism*, and *Statistical methods for neural data*.

**Learning and Memory**  
- What are the mechanisms and rules of synaptic plasticity? Work by [Beatriz](https://odonnellgroup.github.io/people/Beatriz_Mizusaki), [Rachel](https://odonnellgroup.github.io/people/Rachel_Humphries) and [Cian](https://odonnellgroup.github.io/people/Cian_Odonnell).  
- Heterosynaptic plasticity: how do neighboring synapses on a dendrite influence each other? Work by [Rahul](https://odonnellgroup.github.io/people/Rahul_Gupta) and [Sofia](https://odonnellgroup.github.io/people/Sofia_Raak).  
- How does neural replay during sleep contribute to memory? Work by [Will](https://odonnellgroup.github.io/people/Will_Carr) and [Kipp](https://odonnellgroup.github.io/people/Kipp_Freud).  
- How does mitochondria trafficking affect synapse turnover in axons? Work by [Naomi](https://odonnellgroup.github.io/people/Naomi_Berthaut).  
- How can synapses learn probabilistically and energy-efficiently? Work by [James](https://odonnellgroup.github.io/people/James_Malkin)


**Statistical methods for neural data**  
How should we analyse data from large numbers of neurons? We work on statistical methods for analysing large-scale neural datasets, including: probabilistic models of neural population activity distributions, network science methods, and bayesian hierarchal modelling.<br/>
Work by [Sydney](https://odonnellgroup.github.io/people/Sydney_Dimmock), [Kipp](https://odonnellgroup.github.io/people/Kipp_Freud) and [Cian](https://odonnellgroup.github.io/people/Cian_Odonnell).


**Autism**  
What is different in the brains of autistic people? We collaborate with researchers who work on animal models of autism to ask what is different at the level of neural circuits. Currently we are working on the *neural variability hypothesis*: that the brains of autistic people respond with more variability to sensory stimuli. Also asking how computational modelling can inform neural circuit-level understanding of autism mechanisms.<br/>
