## About ##

We are a computational neuroscience research group and part of the [Bristol Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://bristolcnu.github.io) at the [University of Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk) in the fine city of Bristol, UK.

## Research ##
We work on three main areas: *Learning & Memory*, *Autism*, and *Statistical methods for neural data*.

**Learning and Memory**  
What are the mechanisms and rules of synaptic plasticity? How do biophysical properties of synapses constrain or benefit learning? How does memory consolidation work? How does neural replay during sleep contribute to memory?

**Autism**  
What is different in the brains of autistic people? We collaborate with researchers who work on animal models of autism to ask what is different at the level of neural circuits. Currently we are working on the *neural variability hypothesis*: that the brains of autistic people respond with more variability to sensory stimuli.

**Statistical methods for neural data**  
How should we analyse data from large numbers of neurons? We work on statistical methods for analysing large-scale neural datasets, including: probabilistic models of neural population activity distributions, network science methods, and bayesian hierarchal modelling.
