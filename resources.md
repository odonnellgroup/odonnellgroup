## About doing a PhD

PhDs are mysterious to a lot of undergraduate and masters students. In October 2020 I recorded a 20 minute video covering my views on UK PhDs:

- What "doing a PhD" involves
- Reasons to do a PhD
- Reasons to not do a PhD
- How to find and apply for PhDs

It was originally recorded for Bristol Computer Science students but should be relevant for anyone interested in a Science/Engineering PhD in the UK.
