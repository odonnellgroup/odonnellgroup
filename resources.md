## About doing a PhD

PhDs are mysterious to a lot of undergraduate and masters students. In October 2020 I recorded a 20 minute video covering my views on UK PhDs:

- What "doing a PhD" involves
- Reasons to do a PhD
- Reasons to not do a PhD
- How to find and apply for PhDs

[![Want to do a PhD?](https://github.com/odonnellgroup/odonnellgroup.github.io/raw/master/docs/PhDvideo_screenshot.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WNHHp2gT7s "Want to do a PhD?")

Slides pdf [here](https://github.com/odonnellgroup/odonnellgroup.github.io/raw/master/docs/DoingAPhD_CianODonnell.pdf).

It was originally recorded for Bristol Computer Science students but should be relevant for anyone interested in a Science/Engineering PhD in the UK.


## About asking questions in meetings and seminars
We did a group brainstorming session on asking questions:
- Benefits of asking questions
- Types of questions
- Why people realistically often *don't* ask questions
- How to construct good seminar questions
