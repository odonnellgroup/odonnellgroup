## Postdoc
*We are always interested in hearing from potential postdocs*. Please contact Cian early and we can work on figuring out funding. Options include:
- applying for a research grant from the UK government ([BBSRC](https://bbsrc.ukri.org/funding/), [MRC](https://mrc.ukri.org/funding/), [EPSRC](https://epsrc.ukri.org/funding/)) or charity (e.g. [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding), [Leverhulme Trust](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/schemes-at-a-glance)) with you as a named postdoc.
- you applying for your own postdoctoral fellowship, some schemes are:
   - [Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellowships](https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/schemes/sir-henry-wellcome-postdoctoral-fellowships) (up to 4 years funding, open to final year PhD students or early postdocs)
   - [Marie Cure individual fellowship](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/individual-fellowships_en) (1-2 years funding, need a PhD at time of application. Especially suitable if you want to move to UK from elsewhere in Europe or the rest of the world.)

## PhD
**General openings**  
UK PhDs take 3-4 years and usually start in September (although this is flexible). If you would like to do a PhD in the group, we have a range of projects available on computational modelling of synaptic plasticity, learning and memory; and statistical analysis of neural activity data. Most projects involve collaborations with experimentalists either here in Bristol, or Europe or US. Please contact me to discuss funding options, which vary a lot depending on your country of origin. Usually you would need a good Bachelors or Masters degree in computer science, biology, physics, engineering or maths before taking on a computational neuroscience PhD - but other backgrounds are possible. However, the most important thing is not your background, but that you enjoy research work, are curious, and want to understand how the brain works. Our School's next application deadline will be early 2021, suggest contacting Cian in Nov/Dec 2020.

## MSc
We are not taking MSc students this year - please try one of the other supervisors in the [Computational Neuroscience Unit](https://bristolcnu.github.io).

## Undergraduate (BSc and MEng)
If you are a student on the University of Bristol BSc or MEng degree in Computer Science (or a related degree), please contact me early in the academic year to discuss possible computational neuroscience projects. Projects can vary in their 1) level of computational/mathematical difficulty, 2) level of biological detail, and 3) whether they are more focused on computational modelling (simulating the brain) versus statistical data analysis/machine learning. It also would be good, but not essential, if you take or have taken the 3rd year Computational Neuroscience unit.
