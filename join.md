## Open PhD project
![Image by MICRONS project https://www.microns-explorer.org/phase1](https://github.com/odonnellgroup/odonnellgroup.github.io/raw/master/docs/microns.png)
Our group at Ulster University are looking for a computational neuroscience PhD student for a project on “Discovering the rules of neural learning by computer simulations of brain biophysics and deep neural networks.” You will use multiscale computer simulations of electro-chemical signalling in neurons, synapses, and astrocytes to understand how the physical arrangement of different cell types affects brain learning. You can then use more abstract deep neural network models to study the circuit functions of these mechanisms for learning and memory. More details including reading material here: https://www.ulster.ac.uk/doctoralcollege/find-a-phd/1455716.
 
The project will involve collaboration with [Tom Bartol](https://cnl.salk.edu/People/Person/?Person=1116) at the Salk Institute, La Jolla, California.
 
You will join our research group which uses computational tools to do research on synaptic plasticity, learning and memory, autism, and neural data analysis methods: https://odonnellgroup.github.io.
 
You will also be a member of the CNET team in the [Intelligent Systems Research Centre](http://isrc.ulster.ac.uk), a community of researchers working across computational and cognitive neuroscience, neurotechnology, neuromorphic engineering, machine learning, robotics and related fields.
 
We are based in the Derry campus of Ulster University. Derry a lively city of ~100K people on the River Foyle in Northern Ireland, UK. It has a highly affordable cost of living, thriving cultural scene, and access to spectacular coastal scenery and the great outdoors in Donegal and the north coast of Northern Ireland.
 
To be eligible for funding, UK-based applicants should have or expect to obtain an upper second or first-class undergraduate or masters degree. International applicants should have a masters degree. Application deadline is 27th February 2023, for a Sept 2023 start. Application info here: [https://www.ulster.ac.uk/doctoralcollege/find-a-phd/1455716].
 
Please contact Cian (c.odonnell2@ulster.ac.uk) if you are interested or have questions.


## Postdoc

*We are always interested in hearing from potential postdocs*. Please contact Cian early and we can work on figuring out funding. Options include:

- applying for a research grant from the UK government ([BBSRC](https://bbsrc.ukri.org/funding/), [MRC](https://mrc.ukri.org/funding/), [EPSRC](https://epsrc.ukri.org/funding/)) or charity (e.g. [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding), [Leverhulme Trust](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/schemes-at-a-glance)) with you as a named postdoc.
- you applying for your own postdoctoral fellowship, some schemes are:
   - [Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellowships](https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/schemes/sir-henry-wellcome-postdoctoral-fellowships) (up to 4 years funding, open to final year PhD students or early postdocs)
   - [Marie Cure individual fellowship](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/individual-fellowships_en) (1-2 years funding, need a PhD at time of application. Especially suitable if you want to move to UK from elsewhere in Europe or the rest of the world.)

## PhD
**General openings**  



If you would like to do a PhD in the group, we have projects available on neural data science; computational modelling of synaptic plasticity, learning and memory; and synaptic and neural circuit dysfunction in autism. In each case we try to link bottom-up biology with top-down theoretical neuroscience or machine learning ideas. Most projects involve collaborations with experimentalists in UK, or Europe, or the US.
Example directions we are working on:

- The rules of synaptic plasticity: heterosynaptic learning in dendritic neurons.
- Gene expression in neurons: stochasticity and multi-timescale signalling in neuronal protein synthesis.
- Neural variability in autism: origins of circuit variability and its relationship to sensory processing dysfunction in autism.

UK PhDs take 3-4 years and usually start in September (although this is flexible).  Please contact me to discuss funding options, which vary a lot depending on your country of origin. Usually you would need a good Bachelors or Masters degree in computer science, biology, physics, engineering or maths before taking on a computational neuroscience PhD - but other backgrounds are possible. However, the most important thing is not your background, but that you enjoy research work, are curious, and want to understand how the brain works. Our School's application deadline will be early 2022, contact Cian in Nov/Dec 2021.


## MSc and BSc
If you are a student on an Ulster University BSc or MSc degree programme in Computer Science/AI/Data Science, please contact me early in the academic year to discuss possible computational neuroscience projects. Projects can vary in their 1) level of computational/mathematical difficulty, 2) level of biological detail, and 3) whether they are more focused on computational modelling (simulating the brain) versus statistical data analysis/machine learning.
