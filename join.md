## Postdoc
**Job opportunity**: we have a 3-year, BBSRC-funded postdoctoral position available for modelling stochastic gene expression in neurons, to ask if and how it may underlie synapse stability.

You will be based in the group of Cian O'Donnell at Ulster University in Derry, Northern Ireland, UK but closely collaborating with and visiting the mathematical neuroscience group of [Romain Veltz](http://romainveltz.pythonanywhere.com) at INRIA, Sophia-Antipolis, France.
 
In addition to mathematical/computational modelling, as part of the project you will have the opportunity to analyse in vivo and in vitro imaging data from experimental collaborators [Noam Ziv](https://noamziv.net.technion.ac.il), Technion, Israel, and [Haining Zhong](https://www.hainingzhonglab.com), OHSU, USA.
 
You will also be a member of the [Intelligent Systems Research Centre](http://isrc.ulster.ac.uk), which hosts a community of researchers working across computational and cognitive neuroscience, neurotechnology, neuromorphic engineering, machine learning, robotics and related fields.
 
You should have:
- PhD in computational neuroscience/biology, applied mathematics, computer science, engineering, physics, or related field.
- Expertise in one or more programming languages for scientific computing such as Python, Julia, MATLAB, or similar.
- Experience of computational/mathematical modelling of biological or related systems.
 
Derry is lively city of ~100K people situated on the River Foyle, in the north-west of the island of Ireland. It has a highly affordable cost of living, thriving cultural scene, and access to spectacular coastal scenery and the great outdoors in Donegal and the north coast of Northern Ireland.
 
Application deadline is 13th March 2022. Follow [this link](https://www.ulster.ac.uk/about/jobs) and search for job ref 010982.

**Future job opportunities**:
*We are always interested in hearing from potential postdocs*. Please contact Cian early and we can work on figuring out funding. Options include:

- applying for a research grant from the UK government ([BBSRC](https://bbsrc.ukri.org/funding/), [MRC](https://mrc.ukri.org/funding/), [EPSRC](https://epsrc.ukri.org/funding/)) or charity (e.g. [Wellcome Trust](https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding), [Leverhulme Trust](https://www.leverhulme.ac.uk/schemes-at-a-glance)) with you as a named postdoc.
- you applying for your own postdoctoral fellowship, some schemes are:
   - [Sir Henry Wellcome Postdoctoral Fellowships](https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/schemes/sir-henry-wellcome-postdoctoral-fellowships) (up to 4 years funding, open to final year PhD students or early postdocs)
   - [Marie Cure individual fellowship](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/actions/individual-fellowships_en) (1-2 years funding, need a PhD at time of application. Especially suitable if you want to move to UK from elsewhere in Europe or the rest of the world.)

## PhD
**General openings**  
If you would like to do a PhD in the group, we have projects available on computational modelling of synaptic plasticity, learning and memory; and synaptic and neural circuit dysfunction in autism. In each case we try to link bottom-up biology with top-down theoretical neuroscience or machine learning ideas. Most projects involve collaborations with experimentalists here in Bristol, or Europe, or the US.
Example directions we are working on:

- The rules of synaptic plasticity: heterosynaptic learning in dendritic neurons.
- Gene expression in neurons: stochasticity and multi-timescale signalling in neuronal protein synthesis.
- Neural variability in autism: origins of circuit variability and its relationship to sensory processing dysfunction in autism.

UK PhDs take 3-4 years and usually start in September (although this is flexible).  Please contact me to discuss funding options, which vary a lot depending on your country of origin. Usually you would need a good Bachelors or Masters degree in computer science, biology, physics, engineering or maths before taking on a computational neuroscience PhD - but other backgrounds are possible. However, the most important thing is not your background, but that you enjoy research work, are curious, and want to understand how the brain works. Our School's application deadline will be early 2022, contact Cian in Nov/Dec 2021.


## MSc
Projects can vary in their 1) level of computational/mathematical difficulty, 2) level of biological detail, and 3) whether they are more focused on computational modelling (simulating the brain) versus statistical data analysis/machine learning.

## Undergraduate (BSc and MEng)
If you are a student on the University of Bristol BSc or MEng degree in Computer Science (or a related degree), please contact me early in the academic year to discuss possible computational neuroscience projects. Projects can vary in their 1) level of computational/mathematical difficulty, 2) level of biological detail, and 3) whether they are more focused on computational modelling (simulating the brain) versus statistical data analysis/machine learning. It also would be good, but not essential, if you take or have taken the 3rd year Computational Neuroscience unit.
