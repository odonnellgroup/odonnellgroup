I am a mathematics graduate from Trinity College Dublin and hold a PGCE (Mathematics) and MRes (Research Methods) from Queen's University Belfast. While primarily interested in pure mathematics in my undergraduate, I have long been fascinated with the huge variety of problems in life that can be formulated and solved in a mathematical way.

My current research is focused on mathematical models of heterosynaptic plasticity. This includes modelling its mechanisms and biophysical factors (such as proteins, glial cells, and dendritic geometry) over different temporal and spatial domains, as well as researching the functional implications of circuit-level heterosynaptic plasticity in a more abstract and information theoretic way.
