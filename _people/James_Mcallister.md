James is a PhD Researcher in mathematical/computational neuroscience, studying somewhere in the intersection of network structure and function, and is particularly interested in the role that synaptic plasticity has in this dynamic interplay. He is a Mathematics graduate of Trinity College Dublin, and received a PGCE in Mathematics and a Masters in Research from Queen's University Belfast. He is interested in all the ways in which maths is used to better understand the world around us, and, as in the case of neuroscience - the world within us.
