I graduated in 2024 from Ulser University with a BEng in Artificial Intelligence. My PhD aim is to try and make a better definition of the spectrum within autism spectrum disorder, as currently it is very vague. My current goal is to try and find the different factors that effect individuals through factor analysis with the eventual goal to link back to genetics based on the factors found.
